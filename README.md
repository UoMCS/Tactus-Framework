# Tactus-Framework
Tactus is a touchscreen information system for the School, designed and built by us.
All students are invited to contribute to the project, creating "apps" that will appear on the screens, all around the building.

# Can I make an app?
Of course! Apps are essentially small websites, with dynamic content provided by PHP/Javascript.
The code in this repository includes a Framework of PHP/JS and CSS to make developing easier and some example apps.

You can get started by following the [documentation](/UoMCS/Tactus-Framework/blob/master/apps/documentation/app/documentation.md)
within this repository under apps/documentation/app/documentation.md, which [is also provided as a web page](https://web.cs.manchester.ac.uk/tactus-apps/core/documentation/).

# I have another question - who should I ask?
[Gavin Brown](https://web.cs.manchester.ac.uk/tactus-apps/core/staff-profiles/?action=staff&email=Gavin.Brown@manchester.ac.uk), in room g11 on the ground floor. Please email first :-)
